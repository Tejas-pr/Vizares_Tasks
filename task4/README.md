# Task 4: Express.js CRUD API Documentation

### Project Overview

This project is a simple backend API built using Express.js that handles basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API stores data in an in-memory array, meaning it does not use a database.

   ```
4. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on http://localhost:3000/v1/ (don't forget /v1/).
